# Diagrid Solutions Engineer – Take-Home Assignment

Build an application of your choice using at least two Dapr APIs, run it using Diagrid Catalyst, and prepare a short presentation showcasing:

- The problem you are solving
- Why Dapr is a good fit
- How the Dapr APIs are used
- How Catalyst helps manage, observe and operate the system

The goal is to create the application, explain the problem that Dapr is solving, and demonstrate that you have thought about production considerations.

## Requirements

Your application must:

- Use at least two Dapr APIs including the following:
  - Pub/Sub
  - State Management
  - Workflow
  - Service Invocation
  - AI Agents

  **API Reference:** https://docs.dapr.io/reference/api/  
  **Agents framework:** https://docs.dapr.io/developing-ai/dapr-agents/

- Be demonstrated using Diagrid Catalyst
  - Visualize application topology, components, and runtime behavior
  - Use Catalyst as part of your explanation

- Be implemented in one or more of the following languages:
  - Java
  - .NET
  - Python
  - Go

### Application Scenarios

You may choose one of these or propose your own:

- Multi–message-broker, stateful application
- AI agent orchestration
- Business process workflow automation
- Event-driven microservices with stateful processing

Additional inspiration: https://docs.diagrid.io/dapr/use-cases/ai-agents

## Deliverables

**Application source code:** GitHub repository code and a README containing the following:
  - Architecture overview
  - Dapr APIs used and why
  - How to run the application locally

**Catalyst Demo**: 20-30 minute (approx.) live demo on a scheduled interview panel call showcasing the following:
  - Application architecture and behavior
  - Dapr APIs in action
  - Catalyst visualization and insights
  - Future production considerations

## Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated on:

- Effective use of Dapr APIs
- Presentation clarity and communication skills
- Code quality and completeness
- Future production considerations (scalability, resiliency, security, etc.)

### Bonus Points

- Use of more than two Dapr APIs in a cohesive way
- Demonstration of failure scenarios and recovery
- Thoughtful discussion of architectural trade-offs and design decisions
- Mapping the solution to a realistic customer use case
